# Smart Lens Exchange (Lens Replacement Surgery)

Smart Lens Exchange, also known as **Lens Replacement Surgery** or **Refractive Lens Exchange**, involves removing the eye’s natural crystalline lens and replacing it with an **artificial intraocular lens (IOL)** to correct vision.

## Who is Suitable for Smart Lens Exchange?

A patient may be a candidate if they:

- Are **over the age of 40**
- Show **early signs of cataracts**
- **Need reading glasses**
- Experience **poor night vision**

For individuals over 40 seeking **glasses independence**, this procedure may be favored over laser vision correction due to:

- Reduced impact from age-related changes in the natural lens  
- Full simultaneous **distance and near vision** for both eyes

> In contrast, laser eye surgery for older patients often requires **monovision**, where one eye is adjusted more for distance and the other for near tasks.

## Types of Smart Lenses and Their Purposes

After your eye examination, your ophthalmologist will determine the most appropriate lens for your needs. Common premium lens implants include:

### 🌀 Astigmatism Corrective (Toric) Lenses

- Designed with different curves across axes to address **astigmatism**
- Used when standard incisions cannot fully correct higher errors
- Precise alignment using **axis marks** on the eye and lens for optimal vision

### 🔁 Multifocal and Trifocal Lenses

- Enable clear **distance and near vision** with little to no glasses
- Feature **micro-rings** that bend light from varying distances
- Provide natural transition between near and far sight

### 🔄 Mixed Astigmatism + Multifocal Lenses

- Combine astigmatism correction with **multi-distance vision**
- Offer the benefits of both lens designs
