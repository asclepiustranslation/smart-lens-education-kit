# FAQs: Smart Lens Exchange & Excimer Laser Surgeries

## 👓 What is a Smart Lens?

Smart lenses—specifically **trifocal lenses**—are synthetic implants used in cataract surgery to restore **near, middle, and far vision**. They are placed where the eye’s natural lens was removed.

### Purpose of Smart Lenses
- Replace blurred natural lens during cataract surgery
- Avoid glasses post-surgery
- Mimic natural lens functionality

### Ideal Candidates
- Over age 40
- Early cataracts
- Need reading glasses
- Poor night vision

## 🚫 Who Is Not Suitable for Smart Lenses?

Patients **not suited** for smart lens implantation may include those with:

- Strabismus due to amblyopia
- Diabetes-related vascular damage
- Macular degeneration
- Highly distorted corneal shapes
- Uncontrolled glaucoma (may become eligible after stabilization)

## 🔍 Types of Smart Lenses

There are three primary types of lenses:

| Lens Type      | Distance Coverage      | Astigmatism Correction |
|----------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| Monofocal      | Far only               | No                    |
| Multifocal     | Far + Near             | No                    |
| Trifocal       | Near + Mid + Far       | Optional (can include toric) |

- **Trifocal lenses** allow vision at all distances
- **AddOn lenses** may be used for patients with monofocal implants who later develop hypermetropia

### Additional Variants
- **Toric lenses** for astigmatism
- **AddOn lenses** to supplement existing implants

## 🌠 Common Post-Surgery Experiences

- Temporary brightness or dazzling, especially during night driving
- Adjustment period: 2–6 months
- New-generation lenses designed to reduce glare and improve mid-range vision

## 🧾 Important Considerations

Before opting for smart lenses, research the following:

- Lens quality and manufacturer history
- Surgeon’s experience
- Hospital and operating room standards
- Full pre-op examination to assess suitability

# 🧬 Excimer Laser Eye Surgery

Used to correct **refractive errors** such as:

- Myopia (nearsightedness)
- Hyperopia (farsightedness)
- Astigmatism

### How It Works
The **excimer laser** reshapes the cornea to focus light accurately onto the retina.

## 🔧 Common Excimer Procedures

- LASIK
- FEMTO LASIK
- NO-TOUCH LASER
- LASEK
- RELEX SMILE

Each has a unique method for preparing the corneal surface.

## ✅ Am I a Suitable Candidate?

You may qualify if:

- Age 21+
- Vision stable for 12+ months
- No history of corneal diseases like keratoconus
- Not pregnant or nursing

> A full eye exam is required to confirm suitability.

## 😌 Is the Procedure Painful?

- **Anaesthetic drops** make the surgery painless
- Mild discomfort, dryness, or light sensitivity may follow

## ⏱️ Duration & Recovery

- **Laser time**: less than 1 minute per eye
- **Total procedure**: 15–30 minutes
- Recovery:
  - LASIK: 24–48 hours
  - PRK/LASEK: Several days to weeks

## 🕒 Are Results Permanent?

- Corneal reshaping is permanent
- Aging or health issues may still impact vision
- Enhancement surgeries may be necessary later

## ⚠️ Risks & Side Effects

Possible side effects:

- Dry eyes
- Night glare or halos
- Over/under correction
- Infection (rare with proper care)

## 👓 Will I Still Need Glasses?

Most patients achieve **20/20 vision**, but reading or driving glasses may still be needed after age 40.

## 📝 Pre-Op Preparation

- Stop wearing contact lenses 1–2 weeks prior
- Arrange transportation post-surgery
- Follow your doctor's instructions carefully

## 💰 Insurance Coverage

- Usually **not covered** as it’s considered elective
- Check financing options or **Health Savings Accounts (HSAs)**
