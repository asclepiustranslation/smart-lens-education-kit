# ❓ FAQs for Smart Lens Exchange & Excimer Laser Surgeries

## 👁️ What Are Smart Lenses?

Smart lenses are commonly chosen by individuals with **cataracts** who wish to see both **near and far without glasses** after surgery. They're also suitable for those who prefer not to use **glasses or contact lenses**.

- The lens is implanted where the **natural lens** was removed.
- Designed to correct vision across **multiple distances**: near, intermediate, and far.
- May feature technologies like:
  - **Multifocal**
  - **Extended Depth of Focus (EDOF)**
  - **Accommodating**
  - **Light-adjustable optics**

Some smart IOLs dynamically adjust to **light changes** or **muscle movements**, while others use **optical zones** to split light into multiple focal points.

## 🎯 Purpose of Smart Lenses

Smart lenses aim to:

- Improve **visual quality**
- Enhance **contrast sensitivity**
- Expand **depth of focus**

They’re especially beneficial for:

- **Reading**
- **Computer use**
- **Driving** — without corrective eyewear

Multifocal implants offer lifetime comfort for patients, especially:

- Younger individuals not suited for laser surgery
- Those with **poor vision quality**
- High-prescription glasses users seeking **visual independence**

---

## 🚫 Who Is Not a Candidate?

Smart lens surgery may not be suitable for patients with:

- Strabismus due to amblyopia
- Vascular damage from diabetes or other conditions
- Macular degeneration
- Severely distorted corneal shapes
- Uncontrolled glaucoma

> In cases of high intraocular pressure, surgery may be reconsidered after stabilization.

## 🔢 How Many Types of Smart Lenses Are There?

Available types include:

- **Monofocal**
- **Multifocal**
- **Trifocal**
- **Toric**
- **EDOF (Extended Depth of Focus)**

### Summary Table

| Lens Type           | Vision Range         | Astigmatism Correction | Notes                                         |
|---------------------|----------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Monofocal           | Far only             | No                      | Requires reading glasses                      |
| Multifocal          | Near & Far           | No                      | May cause spatial issues in astigmatic patients |
| Trifocal            | Near, Mid, & Far     | Yes (optional)          | Full range vision, some light sensitivity     |
| EDOF                | Extended mid-range   | Optional                 | Smooth focus, reduced glare                   |
| Toric (Add-on)      | Astigmatism only     | Yes                     | Used in combination with other lens types     |

## 🔍 Distinct Types of Intraocular Lenses (IOLs)

### 1. Monofocal IOLs

- **Function:** One distance focus (typically far)
- **Glasses:** Needed for reading/intermediate tasks
- ✅ Pros: Clear, affordable, widely used
- ❌ Cons: Doesn’t treat presbyopia

### 2. Multifocal IOLs

- **Function:** Multiple zones for near, intermediate, and far
- **Glasses:** Rarely needed
- ✅ Pros: Independence from glasses
- ❌ Cons: May cause halos or glare, especially at night

### 3. EDOF IOLs

- **Function:** Extended range without distinct focal zones
- **Glasses:** Occasionally needed for very close tasks
- ✅ Pros: Less glare than multifocal
- ❌ Cons: Near vision not as strong as multifocal

### 4. Accommodating IOLs

- **Function:** Adjusts shape/movement to mimic accommodation
- **Glasses:** Often not needed for daily tasks
- ✅ Pros: Natural range
- ❌ Cons: Varying effectiveness between patients

### 5. Toric IOLs

- **Function:** Corrects astigmatism
- **Design:** Varying power across lens axes
- ✅ Pros: Clear vision without separate correction
- ❌ Cons: Must be positioned precisely

## 🌙 Common Post-Surgery Complaints

- **Evening driving:** Glare or halo around lights
- **Brightness sensitivity:** Temporary dazzle when focusing near

> Eyes typically adjust in **2–6 months**, but those who work in low-light environments should consider **next-gen lenses** designed to reduce glare.

---

## 📌 Key Considerations Before Surgery

Ensure you research:

- **Lens quality**
- **Product lifespan and clinical history**
- **Surgeon’s experience**
- **Clinic and operating room standards**

> A complete exam is essential to confirm lens suitability and to understand what to expect post-surgery.

# ❓ Excimer Laser Eye Surgery – FAQs

## 👁️ What Is Excimer Laser Eye Surgery?

Excimer laser surgery is a form of **refractive surgery** used to correct:

- **Myopia (near-sightedness)**
- **Hyperopia (farsightedness)**
- **Astigmatism**

The **excimer laser reshapes the cornea** so that light can focus properly on the retina.

---

## 🔧 Common Procedures Using Excimer Lasers

- **L.A.S.I.K.**
- **FEMTO LASIK**
- **NO-TOUCH LASER**
- **L.A.S.E.K.**
- **RELEx S.M.I.L.E.** (Refractive Lenticule Extraction → Small Incision Lenticule Extraction)

> Each procedure has a different method for preparing the corneal surface but relies on the **excimer laser** to achieve correction.

---

## ✅ Am I a Suitable Candidate?

You may be eligible if:

- You are **21 years or older**
- Your vision has been **stable for at least 12 months**
