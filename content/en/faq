# FAQs for Smart Lens Exchange & Excimer Laser surgeries

Smart lenses are the primary choice for those who have cataracts and want to see both close and far without glasses after cataract surgery. It is also preferred for those who do not want to use glasses or contact lenses. The smart lens is implanted in the same location in the eye that the person's natural lens was removed.

## What exactly is a smart lens?

A smart intraocular lens (IOL) is an advanced artificial lens implanted into the eye to replace the eye’s natural lens, typically during cataract or refractive lens exchange surgery. Unlike traditional monofocal lenses that only focus on a single distance, smart IOLs are designed to provide enhanced visual performance across multiple distances — near, intermediate, and far — reducing or eliminating the need for glasses.

Smart IOLs may incorporate multifocal, extended depth-of-focus (EDOF), accommodating, or light-adjustable technologies. Some models dynamically respond to changes in lighting or eye muscle movements, simulating the eye’s natural focusing ability (accommodation). Others use specialized optics to split light and provide multiple focal points.

## What is the purpose of Smart Lenses?

These lenses aim to improve visual quality, contrast sensitivity, and depth of focus, making daily activities like reading, computer use, and driving more comfortable without corrective eyewear.

Smart IOLs are a modern solution for patients seeking greater visual independence after cataract surgery or refractive lens replacement.

Multifocal implants are extremely comfortable for patients and eliminate any vision difficulties for the rest of their lives. Multifocal lenses are appropriate for young patients who are not eligible candidates for laser surgery, have poor vision quality, and use glasses with a high number of but do not want to wear glasses.

## Who is not suitable for smart lens surgeries?

Before deciding on surgery, the patient's overall health and all data concerning the patient's eye system should be evaluated. Patients that are not candidates for smart glasses are as follows:

- Who have strabismus because of amblyopia,
- Who have vascular damage caused by diabetes or other factors,
- Who have macular degeneration,
- Who has a wide spectrum of distorted corneal shapes,
- Who has uncontrollable glaucoma,
- After the intraocular pressure is brought back under control and to normal levels, the lens-changing procedure can be altered.

## How many kinds of smart lenses are there?

There are various types of lenses: monofocal, multifocal, trifocal, toric and EDOF (Extended Depth of Focus) lenses.

- Monofocal lenses are only useful for seeing far distances clearly and then require the use of near vision (reading) glasses.
- Multifocal lenses show distance and near clearly but do not offer any solution for astigmatism. In addition, they cause patients with astigmatism to feel like they are stepping on empty space when watching television or descending stairs.
- The basic principle defining an extended depth of focus lens is a single, contiguous, elongated focal point that increases the depth of focus. An ideal EDOF type lens will provide a sharp focus over a wide range.
- Trifocal Lenses allow you to see at all distances without using glasses. In the evenings, dazzle will rise when the lens is pushed closer to the subject. The patient's eyes may be dazzled at first, but they will grow accustomed to it in time.
- This issue may persist for some sensitive patients, but infrequently. As a result, new generation lenses that enable vision from 60 cm and are not dazzled should be utilised.

Furthermore, if the patient has a substantial astigmatic defect, astigmatic qualification is added to all these lenses before the operation, and one of the smart lens types is used, based on the patient's wish and the physician's examination result.

## What are the distinct types of smart lenses?

There are several types of intraocular lenses (IOLs), each designed to address different visual needs after cataract surgery or refractive lens exchange. Here’s a breakdown of the main types:

### 1. Monofocal IOLs

- **Function**: Correct vision at one distance (usually far).
- **Glasses needed**: Yes, for near or intermediate tasks like reading or computer use.
- **Pros**: Clear distance vision, affordable, widely used.
- **Cons**: Does not correct presbyopia.

### 2. Multifocal IOLs

- **Function**: Provide multiple focal points (near, intermediate, and far).
- **Design**: Split incoming light into different zones.
- **Glasses needed**: Often not needed, or rarely for specific tasks.
- **Pros**: Greater independence from glasses.
- **Cons**: May cause halos or glare, especially at night.

### 3. Extended Depth of Focus (EDOF) IOLs

- **Function**: Create an extended range of vision rather than distinct focal points.
- **Glasses needed**: Sometimes for very close tasks.
- **Pros**: Good visual quality with fewer halos and glare than multifocal lenses.
- **Cons**: Near vision may not be as strong as multifocal IOLs.

### 4. Accommodating IOLs

- **Function**: Move or change shape in the eye to mimic the eye's natural focusing ability.
- **Glasses needed**: Often not for daily tasks, though may be needed for very close work.
- **Pros**: More natural range of focus.
- **Cons**: May not work equally well in all patients; results can vary.

### 5. Toric IOLs

- **Function**: Correct astigmatism along with cataracts.
- **Design**: Has different powers in different meridians of the lens.
- **Used in combination with**: Monofocal, multifocal, or EDOF designs.
- **Pros**: Clearer vision without the need for separate astigmatism correction.
- **Cons**: Precise positioning is crucial; rotation can reduce effectiveness.

## What are the common problems following Smart Lens Surgery?

Especially while driving in the evenings, there can be certain complaints such as being dazzled and the feeling of seeing brightness around the light. When the vision of a smart lens is moved to a closer distance, the sensation of seeing brightness around the light increases, but the eyes will become accustomed to this dazzling in 2–6 months.

However, the Smart Lens decision is critical for those who have jobs that require them to work in the evenings. As a result, new generation lenses should be recommended if the sensation of seeing brightness around the light occurs.

## What Factors Should Be Considered in Smart Lenses?

Obtaining information about lens quality, how long these lenses have been used, the doctor's experience, and the operating rooms and hospital circumstances should be prioritised.

You should consult your doctor about what to expect following the Smart Lens Surgery, and you should also be certain of the smart lens after the complete examination that determines the eye's appropriateness.

# What is Excimer Laser Eye Surgery?

Excimer laser surgery is a form of refractive surgery used to correct vision problems such as myopia (near-sightedness), hyperopia (farsightedness), and astigmatism. The laser reshapes the cornea to allow light entering the eye to be properly focused onto the centre of vision.

## What procedures use Excimer lasers?

The most common procedures include:

- L.A.S.I.K.
- FEMTO LASIK
- NO-TOUCH LASER
- L.A.S.E.K.
- RELEx S.M.I.L.E. → ReLEx → (Refractive Lenticle (tissue fragment) Removal) S.M.I.L.E. → (Small Incision Lenticle Extraction)

Each has different approaches to corneal surface preparation, but all use the excimer laser to reshape the cornea.

## Am I a suitable candidate for Excimer laser surgery?

You may be eligible if:

- You are 21 years or older,
- Your vision has been stable for at least 12 months,
- You have healthy eyes, with no history of corneal disease like keratoconus,
- You are not pregnant or nursing.

A comprehensive eye exam is required to determine eligibility.

## Is the procedure painful?

The procedure itself is painless as anaesthetic drops are used. Some patients may experience mild discomfort during the procedure, dry eyes and sensitivity to light after the procedure, but these will disappear within a few days.

## How long does the surgery take?

The actual laser treatment lasts less than a minute per eye, but the total procedure, including preparation, usually takes 15–30 minutes for both eyes.

## What is the recovery time?

- LASIK patients often experience improved vision within 24–48 hours.
- PRK or LASEK may require several days to a week for functional vision and a few weeks for full recovery.

## Are the results permanent?

Corneal reshaping is permanent, but it's possible for your eyes to change as they age or due to other health conditions. Some patients may require enhancement surgery in the future.

## What are the risks and side effects?

Like all surgical procedures, there are risks, including:

- Dry eyes
- Glare or halos at night
- Under correction or overcorrection
- Infection (rare with proper aftercare)

Your surgeon will discuss all potential risks during your consultation.

## Will I still need glasses or contact lenses?

Many patients achieve 20/20 vision or better, but some may still need glasses for specific tasks, like reading or night driving, especially after age 40 (due to presbyopia).

## How should I prepare for the surgery?

- Avoid wearing contact lenses for 1–2 weeks before your evaluation and surgery
- Arrange for someone to drive you home after the procedure
- Follow all pre-operative instructions provided by your doctor

## Is Excimer laser surgery covered by insurance?

Most insurance plans do not cover refractive surgery, as it is considered elective. However, financing options or health savings accounts (HSAs) may be used to cover the cost.

## When Should Laser Surgery or Smart Lenses be Preferred?

Choosing between Smart Lenses (intraocular lens implants) and Excimer Laser Surgery depends on your age, vision needs, and eye health.

- **Excimer Laser Surgery** (like LASIK or PRK) is ideal for younger patients (typically under 45) with stable refractive errors such as myopia, hyperopia, or astigmatism. It reshapes the cornea to correct vision and eliminate or reduce dependence on glasses or contacts.
- **Smart Lenses**, often recommended for people over 45 or those with cataracts or presbyopia, replace the eye’s natural lens with a high-tech intraocular lens (IOL). These lenses can correct multiple vision issues — far, near, and intermediate — often making reading glasses unnecessary.

In general, laser surgery is best for corneal correction, while smart lenses are preferred when the natural lens is aging or cloudy. A thorough eye examination will help determine the most suitable option based on your eye’s anatomy and lifestyle expectations.
